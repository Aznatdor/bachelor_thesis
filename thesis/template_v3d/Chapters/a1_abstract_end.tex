This work investigates the relationship between the minimum flow problem (the Beckmann problem) and 
the optimal transport problem in the case of a discrete space (a connected non-negatively weighted graph).

In the course of the research, the equivalence of the minimum flow problem and the optimal transport problem on a graph was proven. An algorithm for constructing an optimal transport plan from an optimal flow was obtained, and the correctness of the algorithm was proven.
An implementation of the algorithm in Python was presented. A comparative analysis of the algorithm's results with other
methods of constructing the optimal transport plan was also conducted.
